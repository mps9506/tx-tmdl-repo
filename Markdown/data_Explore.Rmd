## EPADATA

Import the data:
```{r}
wd <- here::here()
fp <- file.path(wd, "RawData/epa_tx_tmdl.csv")
df <- read.csv(fp)
```


need to clean it, why does this download with js embedded in the columns?!?!
```{r}
library(dplyr)

df <- df %>%
  select(ID = Listed.Water.ID, Name = Listed.Water.Name, Type = Water.Type.Group, TMDL_ID = Current.TMDL.ID, Need = TMDL.Development.Status)
head(df)
```

Appears that ID references the TCEQ Assessment Unit, rest are self explanitory. Would be great to link these to HUCs, NHD, and nearest STORET and USGS stations.
